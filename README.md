# Stroke Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the occurrence of strokes using various machine learning models. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical inference, and model application.

## Project Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Create statistical summaries and charts.
- Test for anomalies.
- Check for correlations and other relationships between variables.

### 2. Statistical Inference
- Define the target population.
- Form multiple statistical hypotheses and construct confidence intervals.
- Set significance levels and conduct z or t-tests for these hypotheses.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- Apply various machine learning models to predict the "stroke" column using all other features.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and model ensembling.
- Analyze model selection and other methods.
- Use scikit-learn pipelines to make training pipelines more robust.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting strokes using machine learning. By following the steps, you can gain insights into the data and build robust predictive models.
